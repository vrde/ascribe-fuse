The code was hammered together in 1h during the [ascribe hackathon](https://hackathon.ascribe.io).
The implementation is really bad. It's just a proof of concept far from being complete.


# WAT?

`ascribe-fuse` is a simple tool to mount your ascribe collection in your filesystem.


# Why?

Because it's fun! :D


# How to use it?

Log in or sign up to [ascribe](https://www.ascribe.io), go to your settings to get your `Bearer token` and
save it to a enviroment variable called `ASCRIBE_BEARER_TOKEN`. Then run `python main.py`.
